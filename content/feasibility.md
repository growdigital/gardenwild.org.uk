## 1. Summary

There is a nature and climate emergency and the site at Little Milford is an ideal opportunity for Pembrokeshire County Council to demonstrate their climate leadership. The key principle is that biodiversity enhancement does not have to cost agricultural productiveness.

Our vision is an experimental agroforestry showcase which *increases* biodiversity by supporting a diversity of long-term, ecologically viable livelihoods and strengthening ecological and cultural education.

This aligns with the [Welsh Government‘s Net Zero 2035 group](https://netzero2035.wales/), whose recent [reports](https://netzero2035.wales/our-reports/) call for “deliverable pathways to achieve positive climate and nature outcomes with and for their citizens”$^{1}$. 

The objective is to secure grant funding to establish the organisational and physical infrastructure, partner with low-impact land-based stakeholders and establish a long-standing ecological study. The stakeholders‘ cooperation, management practices and nominal rent would ensure long-term site management.

## 2. Site
The site is 3 miles south east of Haverfordwest, on a south facing slope across the Red Water valley from Little Milford Wood, with the Western Cleddau river to the east and Hook Wood to the south east.

It comprises 3 pasture fields of light clay loam about 12 acres in total, and 2 areas of mature woodland of about 5 acres.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_1024/v1742335688/250318-cawr-boundary-acres.webp)

The site is ecologically sensitive, as the Cleddau is a Special Area of Conservation$^{2}$ and a Site of Special Scientific Interest$^{3}$ alongside Hook Wood, and the woodland is classed as Ancient Woodland$^{4}$ as well as being within a National Park$^{5}$.

To protect and increase biodiversity, it is essential that any planting, landscaping and activities take account of the existing ecology onsite and in the neighbouring woodland and valley. 

This is why the element of ecological study and education is so important to the project: not only are links forged with nearby schools, colleges and universities and inspiring the next generation of ecological citizens, the observations arising from these activities provide a baseline and ongoing feedback as to the effectiveness of interventions.
### Existing ecology
A fully funded and well publicised BioBlitz would be co-ordinated with schools, the Local Records Centre, Country Recorders and wildlife charities. This would establish a baseline and create opportunities for ongoing collaboration.

Which species are found where would shape the direction of any planting and activities. For example, the siting of a Forest School would depend on which species are present.

_Ordnance Survey map showing network of footpaths_

The wider area, part of [Pembrokeshire Coast National Park](https://www.pembrokeshirecoast.wales/), is good walking country, and Little Milford and Hook are particularly well served by footpaths. The site is an [hour‘s walk from Haverfordwest](https://grwd.cc/haverfordwest-walk-little-milford), a public footpath runs between the easterly field and woodland, and [Little Milford Wood](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/51.769234/-4.951808), part of the National Trust‘s [Cleddau Woodlands Park](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/wales/cleddau-woodlands),  is a popular site for walkers.

We believe public access should be baked in to the site design for residents and visitors, with a permissive route along the top track forming a loop with existing paths. The facilities necessary for running accessible workshops, such as a disabled composting toilet, basic shelter and picnic benches, could be opened to walkers as well.

## 3. Areas
The key to the project is the creation of a diversity of low impact, long term, land based livelihoods. Each of the areas showcase different skills and produce — the  “sustainable crops” lauded in the How could Wales feed itself by 2035? report.$^{9}$

In addition, each of the areas, with the right balance of co-ordinated, light management, could also *increase* biodiversity.

The main road access is down a residential single track lane, which is unsuitable for any vehicles larger than a long wheelbase van, and 400 yards before the National Trust car park for Little Milford Wood.

The hardcore track of about 1km in total is circular around the whole site, to enable the movement of produce on a trailer without having to reverse.

There's a small parking area to the right of the entrance, with a turning space nearby, a small container for tools, and the first area to the left is the Mam-berllan, the mother orchard.
### 3.1 Mam-berllan
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_1024/v1742500578/250320-satellite-plan-entrance.webp)
_Close-up of CAD mockup from road entrance showing Mam-berllan and Meadow_

A mother orchard of Welsh varieties of top fruit, a genetic bank focussed on preserving the heritage of Welsh apples, plums and pears in Pembrokeshire. It also provides the opportunity for cuttings to be grafted and there is the potential for a small tree nursery.

There are possibly up to 100 varieties of Welsh apples$^{10}$ and the Welsh Pomona of Heritage Cider Apples & Perry Pears$^{11}$ currently lists 39. We would also plant pears, plums and cherries.

The orchard would employ a repeated [quincunx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincunx) pattern to maximise coverage, and there would be room for approximately 200 trees on a semi-vigorous rootstock (eg MM106 for apples).

There are other mother orchards at Aberystwyth University, [Botanic Garden Wales](https://botanicgarden.wales/garden-areas/welsh-orchard/) and [Ian Sturrock‘s nursery](https://iansturrockandsons.co.uk/), with work underway by Cwm Arian for a [Pembrokeshire tree sharing network](https://www.cwmarian.org.uk/eincoed) of 6 mother orchards. [Tyn y Berllan](https://tynyberllan.co.uk/) heritage nursery is also nearby in [Llysyfran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llys-y-fr%C3%A2n) and there are a considerable number of traditional orchards from the DataMapWales survey$^{12}$.

The orchard area would be fenced and the trees guarded, so that the grass could be managed by sheep grazing.
### 3.2 Nursery
A tree nursery to propagate grafted top fruit would help spread the popularity of Welsh varieties. This could be on either a small ad-hoc scale or with the potential for a more commercial operation.

A potential source of income would be growing native rootstocks by [stooling](https://propg.ifas.ufl.edu/08-layering/07-layering-mound.html), which would be better for biosecurity .
### 3.3 Meadow
We contacted local land worker [Mat Evans](https://humanpowered.co.uk/), via [Coppicewood College](https://coppicewoodcollege.co.uk/) about the opportunities for low impact productive management. He‘s interested in running scything and hedgelaying workshops, making charcoal and possibly some minor tree work in suitable areas in the woodland.

The meadow of just under an acre would be managed for maximum species diversity, used as a hay crop for the sheep, and for harvesting wild flower seeds. It would also provide alternative habitat to the sheep grazed pasture.

At the top of the meadow would be a simple canvas shelter for workshop participants. 
### 3.4 Willow plantation
There is the potential to run willow weaving workshops, again using the canvas shelters. We have been in touch with living willow artist [Michelle Cain](https://www.topofthewoods.co.uk/post/2017/05/12/kiss-of-the-giant-badger-and-the-creation-of-the-new-hide-seek-garden) about different varieties and cropping times. Willow is great [early in the year for pollinators](https://botanicgarden.wales/press/create-a-special-spring-haven-for-pollinators/).
### 3.5 Perllan Cadernid
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_1024/v1742506502/250320-cad-plan-perllan-cadernid.webp)
_Perllan Cadernid, the Resilient Orchard of climate adapted species and cultivars_

This is the Resilient Orchard, a mixture of species and varieties chosen for their potential to deal with reduced chilling hours (the amount of cold required for the blossom to be viable) and extreme weather conditions of rain and drought.

In contrast to the Mam-berllan which is about preserving culturally important varieties, this area is about how productive the plants are. For example there would be warmer climate commercial apple varieties like Braeburn, Gala, Fuji, Golden Delicious etc to see how well they perform.

It is an also an opportunity to trial different species, such as the Cornelian Cherry (a near-native cornus) and Aronia (a common Eastern Europe fruit crop from North America).

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_400/v1742506972/180728-Cornus-mas-berry-Andreas-Rockstein.webp)
_Cornus mas, near-native with edible fruits_

As highlighted before, we do need to be very careful about species choice in such an ecologically sensitive area, to make sure that there is no possibility of planting anything invasive or detrimental. This is why good, ongoing communication with ecologists on design decisions is essential.

On the outside of the orchard are guarded fruit and nut trees, with the understorey grazed by sheep. The heart of the orchard is fenced, as it contains a mixture of top fruit and soft fruit.
### 3.6 Nuttery Coppice
Hazels were once a staple crop in Wales$^{13}$, and as a native species, it has considerable potential as a resilient crop for a changing climate, with a calorific value per acre close to wheat.

As far as we are aware, there are no examples of a nuttery in Pembrokeshire, so it would be a very valuable trial area to showcase different horticultural techniques.
### 3.7 Silvopasture
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_1024/v1742508844/250320-cad-plan-silvopasture.webp)
_Nut trees protected by windbreak hedges with baffles_

The Silvopasture area is nut and possibly timber trees grown to full-size and guarded so the understorey can be grazed by sheep, using existing connections with local farmers.

The windbreak hedges are planted along contour lines, to reduce run-off into the river, and are designed with baffles to allow free movement of sheep. The hedges should be predominantly native species, and providing additional habitat and food source.

The potential nut crops are all non-native (eg Walnut, Sweet Chestnut) but with a long history of cultivation, so any potential for invasiveness would be well documented. The trees would start cropping in about 5 years.

## 4. Livelihoods
A diversity of people who work with the land are at the heart of this plan, as these stakeholders are essential for maintaining a heightened level of biodiversity. 

Long term leases and timescales are essential for creating the infrastructure for sustainable livelihoods, and it takes time to build up the necessary networks of relationships.

In essence, the project is a showcase of diverse agroforestry practices, combining perennial crops with livestock. [Wakelyns Farm](https://wakelyns.co.uk/) in Suffolk call this [enterprise stacking](https://wakelyns.co.uk/joinus/). To capitalise on existing connections with local farms, the grazing would be with sheep, which also reduces the cost of guarding the trees compared to cattle.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/hopegarden/image/upload/w_400/v1726511011/240913-yusef-ysgol-cilgerran-fleabane.jpg)
_Wildlife ID project with Ysgol Cilgerran, Pembrokeshire_

Woven into the agroforesty is a strong emphasis on education, starting with a networked BioBlitz, and with sustained contact with local schools for wildlife ID workshops in different habitats. These workshops would make use of the three canvas shelters across the site. We have met with Ross Williams, the headteacher at Hook and Johnston schools, and he‘s expressed a keen interest. 

By involving West Wales Biodiversity Information Centre and County Recorders, we could raise enough interest in the site for it to be the centre of a long term ecological study, with visits from colleges such as Bridgend and universities.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_400/v1742510662/151115-hedgelaying-Graham-Teece.webp)

Willow, scything and hedgelaying workshops would also use the same space, and provide practical skills for residents and visitors.

We have also had interest in running a Forest School, the location of which would depend on the results of the ecology surveys.

---
## 5. Management
The long-term management of the site relies upon the stakeholders‘ activities eg hedgelaying, grazing, pruning, harvesting. And it relies on pooling a percentage of profits into a co-operative structure to cover the ongoing maintenance costs for the track, gates, fencing, toilet etc. The co-operative would be the point of contact for the Council.

Because the infrastructure, both physical and organisational, will take time to establish, there would be a 5 year moratorium on the rent, which would be factored in to the grant application.

Exactly how much rent each stakeholder would pay, and how any percentage of profits would be calculated would be part of the co-design process, as would the research and establishment of a co-operative structure.

The leases would also need careful consideration and planning. Some would be a minimum of 10 years, depending on the crop.

**Designing and managing with ecologists is at the heart of the decision making process**.
### Time to cropping
- Willow - 3 years
- Top fruit - 5 years
- Hazel coppice - 8 years 
- Nut silvopasture - 5 years+
- Timber coppice - 20 years
- Hedgelaying - rotation 6 years

---
## 6. Funding
The project relies on up-front grant funding over 5 years to set up the infrastructure for the landscaping and planting, and to set up the design and management processes with the stakeholders.

The rent is currently approximately £2k pa (£150 per acre pa for pasture, £20 for woodland). Because it will take some years for cropping and thus revenue to come in, there would be a rent moratorium for 5 years.

Following the co-design process, where potential stakeholders would be paid as consultants for their input, a cooperative business would be established for those wishing to invest in the site. It would be the primary legal and financial contact with the Council.

The [National Lottery Heritage Fund](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk/) provides multi-year grants for [heritage projects](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk/funding/what-we-fund), and the Woodland Trust provides [support for agroforestry projects](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/plant-trees/trees-for-landowners-and-farmers/).
