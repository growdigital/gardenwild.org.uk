Garden Wild is a [CIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) dedicated to community climate action through forest gardening and native plants.

By highlighting and showcasing the benefits of food forest gardens, grown in combination with native wild flowers and plants, we aim to share knowledge and ideas with community projects across the UK.
