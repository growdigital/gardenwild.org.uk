Garden Wild is a [CIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) dedicated to sharing the benefits of using wild flowers in all of our gardens, whether ornamental, wildlife or edible.

By highlighting and showcasing the benefits of UK native wild flowers and plants, we aim to increase their use across all horticultural sectors, benefitting UK native wildlife and reducing the ecological impact of the horticultural industry.
