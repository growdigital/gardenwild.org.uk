### UK Wild Flower Gallery 

The initial focus of our work is the creation of a freely accessible photo gallery of Wild Flower plants, suitable for different situations and for benefitting different wildlife. Plant combinations will also be highlighted, providing inspiration for those wanting to transition from more traditional horticulture.

### UK Wild Flower book 

The second stage of our work is the publication of a UK Wild Flower Gardening book, suitable for a whole range of gardeners who might not be adept at using a website resource. The presentation of high quality photographs will also showcase the beauty of wild flowers more effectively and immediately, providing another route in for interested amateur gardeners.

### Online workshops & courses

The final and ongoing stage is the practical demonstration of planning, propagating and planting out and maintaining UK native wild flower plants, via real time workshops and recorded online courses.
