### Hope Garden

A community meeting space at the heart of a wildlife forest garden, the [Hope Garden](https://hopegarden.uk/) in [north Pembrokeshire, Wales](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ag53Cc6TAULTVE75A), is born from plans for a ecologically challenging community assembly at an RHS show garden, and morphed into a prototype, outdoor classroom and edible perennial plant library.

### Wildlife Allotments

We have taken the ideas from the Food Forest Show Garden and developed them further, to create Wildlife Allotments. Everybody knows what an allotment is, and by concentrating on the wildlife aspects, we can introduce sustainable gardening practices such as perernnial vegetables and permanent ground cover.

### Food Forest Show Garden

We applied unsuccessfully for National Lottery funding in July 2022 for a community allotment and orchard coupled with a food forest show garden business for the town of Newcastle Emlyn (there are _no_ allotments in the town).

The food forest show gardens will demonstrate sustainable gardening methods, plants and combinations for different sized plots, supported by workshops, with the whole process documented online.

### UK Wild Flower Gallery

We applied for funding in 2021 for the creation of a freely accessible photo gallery of Wild Flower plants, suitable for different situations and for benefitting different wildlife. Alas, we were unsuccessful.

The gallery would be useful for both forest gardens and more traditional ornamental gardens, as native plants are more beneficial as they have co-evolved with wildlife.

The architecture for the project remains in place, we just need to find a funding source.
