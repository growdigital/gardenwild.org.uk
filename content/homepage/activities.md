### Allotments & Food Forest Show Garden

We have applied for National Lottery funding in July 2022 for a community allotment and orchard coupled with a food forest show garden business for the town of Newcastle Emlyn (there are _no_ allotments in the town).

The food forest show gardens will demonstrate sustainable gardening methods, plants and combinations for different sized plots, supported by workshops, with the whole process documented online.

### UK Wild Flower Gallery

We applied for funding in 2021 for the creation of a freely accessible photo gallery of Wild Flower plants, suitable for different situations and for benefitting different wildlife. Alas, we were unsuccessful.

The gallery would be useful for both forest gardens and more traditional ornamental gardens, as native plants are more beneficial as they have co-evolved with wildlife.

The architecture for the project remains in place, we just need to find a funding source.
